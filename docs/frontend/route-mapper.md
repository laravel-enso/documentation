### Demo

For live examples and demos, you may visit [laravel-enso.com](https://www.laravel-enso.com)

### Installation

Install the package:
```
yarn add @enso-ui/route-mapper
```

(within Enso, remember to `cd` into the `client` folder before installing front-end assets)

NOTE that as of version `1.0.8` this package need to be transpiled, so for an Enso project,
you need to include it the `transpileDependencies` array within `vue.config.js`.
